Keep your [AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) groups and users](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) in sync with your [Google Workspace directory](https://workspace.google.com/) using and [AWS Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

![On AWS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slashdevops/idp-scim-sync/main/docs/images/diagrams/ipd-scim-sync.drawio.png)

As the image above shows, the [AWS Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) is triggered by a [CloudWatch event rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule-schedule.html), the event rule is configured to run every [15 minutes (default in the cfn template)](template.yaml), and `sync` the `AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) groups and users` with `Google Workspace directory` using their respective `APIs`.  During the `first sync`, the data of the `Groups and Users` are stored in the `AWS S3 bucket` as [the State file](docs/State-File-example.md)

[The State file](docs/State-File-example.md) is a custom implementation to save time and requests to the [AWS SSO SCIM API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html), also mitigate some limitations of this.

This project is developed using the [Go language](https://go.dev/) and [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-specification.html), a tool for creating, [publishing](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo) and deploying `AWS Serverless Applications` in an easy way.

If you want to know what creates the [CloudFormation Template](template.yaml), please check the [AWS SAM Template](docs/AWS-SAM-Template.md)

__First time implementing [Single Sign-on on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on)? please read [Using SSO](docs/Using-SSO.md)__

The best way to to deploy and use this is through the [AWS Serverless public repository - slashdevops/idp-scim-sync](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/us-east-1/889836709304/idp-scim-sync)

## Features

* Efficient data retrieval from Google Workspace API using [Partial response](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api#partial-response)
* Supported nested groups in Google Workspace thanks to [includeDerivedMembership](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/members/list#query-parameters) API Query Parameter
* Could be used or deployed via `AWS Serverless repository (Public)`, `Container Image` or `CLI`. See [Repositories](#Repositories)
* Incremental changes, drastically reduced the number of requests to the [AWS SSO SCIM API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html) thanks to the implementation of [State file](docs/State-File-example.md)

## Important

The documentation is a __WIP__ and you can contribute!

## Limitations

Most of the limitations of this project are due to [AWS SSO SCIM API Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html).

* Use less than 50 Groups -->  [AWS SSO SCIM API (ListGroups)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/listgroups.html#Constraints) has a limit of 50 Groups per request.  I created these tickets in AWS Support site [AWS SSO SCIM API pagination for methods](https://repost.aws/questions/QUqqnVkIo_SYyF_SlX5LcUjg/aws-sso-scim-api-pagination-for-methods) and [AWS SSO SCIM API ListGroups members](https://repost.aws/questions/QURqsaKxH9SqWYsBJ9UDdAPg/aws-sso-scim-api-list-groups-members), `please considere supporting this ticket with your` 👍.
* Too much Users and Groups could generate a `ThrottlingException` of the some [AWS SSO SCIM API methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html)
* Google Workspace API doesn't separate normal and guest users expect for status (guest miss status), so only `ACTIVE` users are collected to model as group members. Logically all users who are wanted (and capable of) to sign in are `ACTIVE`.

NOTES:

1. The use of the [The State file](docs/State-File-example.md) could mitigate the number `1`, but I recommend you be cautious of these limitations as well.
2. The project implements a [well-known HTTP Retryable client (/go-retryablehttp)](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp) to mitigate the number `2`, but I recommend you be cautious of these limitations as well.

### Users that coming from the project [SSO Sync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync)

* This project only implement the `--sync-method` `groups`, so if you are using the `--sync-method` `users_groups` you can't use it, because this is going to delete and recreate your data in the AWS SSO side.
* This project only implement the `filter` for the `Google Workspace Groups`, so if you are using the `filter` for the `Google Workspace Users`, you can't use it. Please see [Using SSO](docs/Using-SSO.md) for more information.
* The flags names of this project are different from the ones of the [SSO Sync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync)
* Not "all the features" of the [SSO Sync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync) are not implemented here, and maybe will not.

## Components

1. [idpscim](docs/idpscim.md) is a program for keeping [AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) groups and users](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) synced with [Google Workspace directory service](https://workspace.google.com/) using the [AWS SSO SCIM API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html). Details [here](docs/idpscim.md).
2. [idpscimcli](docs/idpscimcli.md) is is a command-line tool to check and validate some functionalities implemented in `idpscim`. Details [here](docs/idpscimcli.md).

```bash
make clean
make test # optional
make build-dist
```

then the binaries are in `dist/` folder.

* Others Operating Systems, see the list of supported platforms in the [syslist.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/build/syslist.go)

```bash
make clean
GO_OS=<something from goosList in syslist.go> GO_ARCH=<something from goarchList in syslist.go> make test # optional
GO_OS=<something from goosList in syslist.go> GO_ARCH=<something from goarchList in syslist.go> make build-dist
```

then the binaries are in `dist/` folder.

* Execute

```bash
./idpscim --help
#or
./idpscimcli --help
```

#### Using the pre-built binaries

This is the easy way, just download the binaries you need from the [github repository releases](https://github.com/slashdevops/idp-scim-sync/releases)
